# Book-Selling

A Java-based application/library for managing book inventory, customers, orders, and sales workflows. This repository contains the source code for Book-Selling â€” a concise, extensible foundation for building point-of-sale (POS), e-commerce backend, or inventory-management tools for bookstores.

> Language: Java (100%)

## Features
- Inventory management (add / update / remove books)
- Customer records and order handling
- Order lifecycle (create, update, complete/cancel)
- Pricing and simple discount rules
- Persistence-ready design (in-memory + pluggable DAO for databases)
- Modular, object-oriented Java code suitable for extension

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or newer recommended.
- A build tool (Maven or Gradle) is recommended, but the project can be compiled with javac if no build tool is present.

Check your Java version:
```bash
java -version
```

### Build and run

If this repository uses Maven (pom.xml present):
```bash
# Build
mvn clean package

# Run (replace com.example.Main with your actual main class)
java -cp target/*:target/dependency/* com.example.Main
# Or, if a fat-jar is produced:
java -jar target/book-selling.jar
```

If this repository uses Gradle (build.gradle present):
```bash
# Build (Linux / macOS)
./gradlew build

# On Windows
gradlew.bat build

# Run (replace com.example.Main with your actual main class)
java -jar build/libs/book-selling.jar
```

If no build tool is used, compile with javac:
```bash
# From repository root (example assuming src/main/java layout)
javac -d out $(find src/main/java -name '*.java')
java -cp out com.example.Main
```

Replace `com.example.Main` with the fully qualified main class in the project (search `public static void main` to find it).

## Configuration
This project is designed to keep configuration simple. Typical configuration locations:
- src/main/resources/application.properties (or application.yml)
- Environment variables for secrets / database URLs
- Command-line arguments for runtime options

If a persistence backend is added (JDBC, JPA, etc.), configure connection details via properties files or environment variables.

## Project structure (recommended)
A typical layout for a Java project in this repo might look like:
```
src/
  main/
    java/
      com/yourorg/bookselling/
        Main.java
        model/
          Book.java
          Customer.java
          Order.java
        dao/
          BookDao.java
          InMemoryBookDao.java
        service/
          InventoryService.java
          OrderService.java
        util/
    resources/
  test/
    java/
```

Feel free to adapt packages and structure to your preferred conventions.

## Usage examples

- Programmatic use (library-style):
  - Create services (InventoryService, OrderService), add books, create orders via service APIs.

- CLI-style:
  - Build a small console UI that reads commands (add-book, list-books, create-order) and invokes services.

Example pseudo-code:
```java
InventoryService inventory = new InventoryService(new InMemoryBookDao());
inventory.addBook(new Book("978-1234567897", "Example Title", "Author", 19.99, 10));
OrderService orders = new OrderService(inventory);
orders.createOrder(customer, List.of(new OrderLine("978-1234567897", 2)));
```

## Testing
If the project includes tests and uses Maven/Gradle, run:
```bash
# Maven
mvn test

# Gradle
./gradlew test
```

If tests rely on JUnit or other test frameworks, ensure they are available on the classpath.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! A suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
3. Add tests for new functionality.
4. Commit and push your changes.
5. Open a pull request describing your change.

Please follow these guidelines:
- Keep public APIs stable when possible.

## Roadmap
Possible future improvements:
- Add persistent storage implementations (JPA/Hibernate, JDBC, or NoSQL)
- REST API layer (Spring Boot)
- Authentication & user management
- Reporting and analytics
- UI (web or desktop)

If you have other suggestions, please open an issue describing the idea.
